                        DEPLOY

The simplest web server. The directory at the root of the web server, and
its sub directories may assume the following functions:

    .               the web server proper and test utilities
    common          supporting utility functions
    data            for database related
    content         where the files live
        siteicons       icons for this site
        media           images, media
        static          files that may be presented as is
        proj*           python and html / css files that make up the site

  To create a <b>new project</b>, add a new directory that starts with "proj"
 (like "proj-000") and populate the files. At least one python file is needed.

    To create a <b>new page</b>, add a new python file, and call the
URL registration function(s) within. The server redirects the url
to the function you specify.

  add_one_url("/", got_index, "index.html")

 To create a new 'macro' use the add macro function with the macro name
and the name of the function that is executed by the macro. The macro
will be replaced by the return value of the function. The macro
is created by surrounding braces with a space. Like: { mymacro }
The macro regex is '{ .*? }' [the '?' is for non greedy wild card)

 add_one_func("mymacro", my_img_func)

 Builtin macros:

 { image nnn }          --  Put an image tag nnn in the output
 { image nnn www }      --  Put an image tag in the output, resize width to requested
 { image nnn www hhh }  --  Put an image tag in the output, resize to width / height

The first two forms of the { image } function will preserve the image's aspect ratio.
