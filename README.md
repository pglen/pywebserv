# Wsgi Web Server

## WSGI compliant web server

 Web server with no dependencies (for security). One might say this is a framework-less framework.

 What works:

   * First page delivered
   * Dynamic page gen
   * Template expansion { vars } are substituted recursively
   * connected to apache2 (tests OK)
   * image re-size from { vars } arguments ex: { image any.png 800 }
   * first test site (see below)
   * apache binding tested via the WSGI interface

 History:

    Sun 20.Mar.2022 First live site on the web
    Tue 28.Jun.2022 Created unitedplanetpeace.com proto site

 On the screen shot below, images are added, images are dynamically re sized with the PIL
 library;

  ![screen shot of image processing](content/siteicons/next_step.png)

 On the screen shot below, projects are added in a separate sub directory;
 The project is isolated, errors in the project do not influence the site;
 only the page with error, and only an error message shows.

  Variable subst regex: "{ .*? }"  (example: { header } )
  Command parameter subst regex: "\[ .*? \]"  (example: [ value_one ] )

  See index.html for examples.

| Directories: | Usage |
|  ------------|-------------|
|  /content/proj*      | for applications / projects |
|  /content/siteicons/ | for icons                   |
|  /content/media/     | for image content           |
|  /content/static/    | for static (non changing) content|

### Flow of presenting the pages:

    url lookup in main ->
        if entry present
            if html file exists:
                expand macro -> present page
            else
                call function in url table
                function fills in everything -> present
        else
            if static file ->
                present it
            else
                if 404 file
                    present it
                else
                    404 message

 To create a new project:

    Add a directory to the web server content directory
        that starts with 'proj' (like proj-hello or proj-sales)
    fill in the directory with content
        o Initial .py file to configure the project (any name)
        o Content that responds to the callbacks, or presented as is

    See proj-index for an example home page. Also proj* for more
    detailed examples. Please note how simple a calendar
    implementation becomes.
