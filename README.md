# wsgi webserver

 WSGI compliant web server, initial steps

 Nothing useful, but first steps are successful.

 Web server with no dependencies (for security) One might say this is a framework-less framework.

 What works:

   First page delivered
   Dynamic page gen
   Template expansion { vars } are substituted recursively
   connected to apache2 (tests OK)
