# Wsgi Web Server

## WSGI compliant web server

 Web server with no dependencies (for security). One might say this is a framework-less framework.

 What works:

   * First page delivered
   * Dynamic page gen
   * Template expansion { vars } are substituted recursively
   * connected to apache2 (tests OK)
   * image re-size from { vars } arguments ex: { image any.png 800 }
   * first test site (see below)

 On the screen shot below, images are added, images are dynamically re sized with the PIL
 library;

 On the screen shot below, projects are added in a separate sub directory;
 The project is isolated, errors in the project do not influence the site;
 only the page with error, and only an error message shows.

  Variable subst regex: "{ .*? }"  (example: { header } )
  Command parameter subst regex: "\[ .*? \]"  (example: [ value_one ] )

  See index.html for examples.

    Files:
        _global for url to function mapping
        _content for stuff
        _globals for static stuff and { var }  definitions

   Directories:
        projects for application projects
        siteicons for icons
        media for image content

 Flow of presenting:

    url lookup in main ->
        if entry present
            if html file exists:
                expand macro -> present page
            else
                call function in url table
                function fills in everything -> present
        else
            if static file ->
                present it
            else
                if 404 file
                    present it
                else
                    404 message

 To create a new project:

    Add a directory to the web server content directory
        that starts with 'proj' (like proj-hello or proj-sales)
    fill in the directory with content
        o Initial .py file to configure the project (any name)
        o Content that responds to the callbacks, or presented as is

    See proj-index for an example hoem page. Also proj* for more
    detailed examples. Please note how simple a calendar
    implementation becomes.
