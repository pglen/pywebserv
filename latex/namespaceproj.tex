\begin{DoxyVerb}    This is a sample project that is added to the site. The idea here is
    that nothing in this project can syntax error (down) the site.
    It is imported under a try: except clause, and it is calling only the
    URL registration functions and macro definitons.
    Also, included a default web page function as index.html or as '/'
