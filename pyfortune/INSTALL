                        INSTALL

 Execute sudo ./install.py

  If you do not have admin access, you may install the utility in any
directory, and use the '-d' option to point to the fortune files.

 Examples:

    ./pyfortune.py -d datfiles

  ... or ...

    cp -a datfiles ~/
    cp pyfortune.py ~/bin
    pyfortune.py -d ~/datfiles

 This is a contrived example, but you get the idea.

 To display a nice fortune at terminal startup, add the following line to
your ~/.bashrc file:

pyfortune.py

 Have fun.
